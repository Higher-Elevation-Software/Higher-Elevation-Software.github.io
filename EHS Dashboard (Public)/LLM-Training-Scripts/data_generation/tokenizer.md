# data_generation/tokenizer.py

This Python file contains a tokenizer utility for estimating the token count of text and truncating text to fit within a specified token limit. This functionality is particularly useful in the context of language models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo, where the input text needs to be within a certain token range.

## `estimate_token_count(text)`

> [!note]
> This function uses OpenAI's tokenizer to estimate the token count of the provided text.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The input text to be analyzed.

**Returns:**
- `int`: The estimated token count of the input text.

## `truncate_text_by_tokens(text, max_tokens)`

> [!note]
> This function truncates the input text to fit within the specified token limit.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The input text to be truncated.
- `max_tokens` (int): The maximum number of tokens allowed.

**Returns:**
- `str`: The truncated text, if the original text exceeds the token limit. Otherwise, the original text is returned.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the `tiktoken` library, which is a fast, open-source tokenizer for various language models, including GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Design Considerations

The `estimate_token_count` and `truncate_text_by_tokens` functions are designed to be simple and efficient, allowing for easy integration into larger data processing pipelines. The use of the `tiktoken` library ensures that the tokenization is consistent with the language model being used, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the input data.
