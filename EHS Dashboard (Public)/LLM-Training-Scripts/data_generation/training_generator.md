# data_generation/training_generator.py

This Python file is responsible for generating training data for an AI-powered code assistant. It utilizes the OpenAI API to provide dynamic responses to various prompts, such as code summarization, debugging insights, security assessments, and test case recommendations. The file also includes utilities for estimating the cost of running the training data generation process.

## Key Components

### `estimate_task_cost()`
This function estimates the total token usage and cost before running the training data generation process. It iterates through the available repositories, extracts the relevant files, and calculates the approximate input and output tokens, as well as the estimated cost.

### `call_openai_api(prompt)`
This function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the provided prompt. It handles any exceptions that may occur during the API call and returns the response or an error message.

### `generate_assistant_response(prompt_type, filename, content, context)`
This function generates an AI-driven response dynamically using the OpenAI API. It extracts code statistics from the provided content, selects the appropriate prompt template, and constructs the system and user prompts. The function then calls the `call_openai_api()` function to obtain the AI-generated response.

### `create_training_pairs(filepath, content, repo_name)`
This function creates training pairs from the given file content. For demonstration purposes, it uses the 'summarize' prompt type to generate a training response. The function returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a training pair.

## Dependencies and Design Patterns

The file utilizes the following dependencies:

- `openai`: The OpenAI Python SDK for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- `logging`: The Python standard library logging module for logging messages.

The file follows the following design patterns:

- **Stub Implementation**: The `extract_code_statistics()` function is a stub implementation that can be replaced with actual logic as needed.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: The file attempts to import `extract_docs` and `REPOS` from the `data_generation.extractor` module, and provides fallbacks if the imports fail.
