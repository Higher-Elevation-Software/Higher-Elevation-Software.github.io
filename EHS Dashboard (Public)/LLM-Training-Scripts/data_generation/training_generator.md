# data_generation/training_generator.py

This Python file is responsible for generating training data for an AI-powered code assistant. It utilizes the OpenAI API to provide dynamic responses to various prompts, such as code summarization, debugging insights, security assessments, and test case recommendations. The file also includes utilities for estimating the cost of running the training data generation process.

## Key Components

### `estimate_task_cost()`
This function estimates the total token usage and cost before running the training data generation process. It iterates through the available repositories, extracts the relevant files, and calculates the approximate input and output tokens, as well as the estimated cost.

### `call_openai_api(prompt)`
This function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the provided prompt. It handles any exceptions that may occur during the API call and returns the response or an error message.

### `generate_assistant_response(prompt_type, filename, content, context)`
This function generates an AI-driven response dynamically using the OpenAI API. It extracts code statistics from the provided content, selects the appropriate prompt template, and constructs the system and user prompts. The function then calls the `call_openai_api()` function to obtain the AI-generated response.

### `create_training_pairs(filepath, content, repo_name)`
This function creates training pairs from the given file content. For demonstration purposes, it uses the 'summarize' prompt type to generate a response, which is then included in the training pair.

## Dependencies and Design Patterns

The file utilizes the following dependencies:

- `openai`: The OpenAI API client for generating AI-driven responses.
- `logging`: The Python logging module for handling logging and error reporting.

The file follows a modular design, with separate functions for specific tasks, such as cost estimation, API calls, and response generation. This design promotes maintainability and testability of the codebase.

> Ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set before running the code, as it is required for the OpenAI API calls.
