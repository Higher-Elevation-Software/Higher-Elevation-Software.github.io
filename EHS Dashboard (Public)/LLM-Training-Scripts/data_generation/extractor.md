# data_generation/extractor.py

This Python script is responsible for extracting and reading files from various repositories, focusing on specific file types and excluding certain directories. The extracted content is then returned as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the file path and the file's content.

## Constants

The script defines several constants that are used throughout the code:

- `MIN_CONTENT_LENGTH`: The minimum length of the file content to be considered for extraction.
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: The maximum file size (in megabytes) to be considered for extraction.
- `REPOS`: A dictionary that defines the repository paths and the file extensions to be extracted from each repository.
- `EXCLUDED_DIRS`: A set of directories that should be excluded from the extraction process.

## Functions

### `should_skip_file(filepath)`

This function determines whether a file should be skipped based on its size or the directory it is located in. It checks if the file is located in any of the `EXCLUDED_DIRS` and if the file size exceeds the `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` limit.

### `extract_docs(repo_path, extensions)`

This function extracts and reads files from the specified repository path, considering the provided file extensions. It uses the `glob.glob()` function to find all files matching the specified pattern, and then reads the content of each file. If the file content length is greater than or equal to the `MIN_CONTENT_LENGTH`, the file path and content are added to the `docs` list. The function also handles any exceptions that may occur during the file reading process.

## Usage

To use this script, you would typically call the `extract_docs()` function for each repository defined in the `REPOS` dictionary, and then process the extracted content as needed. For example:

```python
for repo_name, repo_info in REPOS.items():
    docs = extract_docs(repo_info["path"], repo_info["extensions"])
    # Process the extracted documents as needed
    for filepath, content in docs:
        print(f"File: {filepath}")
        print(f"Content: {content}")
```

This would extract the files from all the repositories defined in the `REPOS` dictionary and print the file path and content for each extracted document.
