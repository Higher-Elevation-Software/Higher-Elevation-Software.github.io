# claude_prompt.py Documentation

This file is a Python script that generates Obsidian-compatible documentation for a codebase using the Anthropic Claude language model. It processes all Python files in the current directory (excluding test files and certain directories) and creates detailed documentation for each file, following a set of rules to ensure the documentation is well-structured and formatted for use in Obsidian.

## Key Components

### Importing Necessary Modules
The script starts by importing the necessary modules, including `os`, `json`, `glob`, `sys`, and `anthropic`.

### Configuring the Anthropic Client
The script sets up the Anthropic client using the API key stored in the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### Selecting Files to Process
The script determines the files to process, either based on the command-line arguments or by finding all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories (excluding certain directories and test files).

### Generating Documentation
The script iterates through the selected files, processing each one and generating Obsidian-compatible documentation. The documentation follows the rules specified in the prompt, including:

1. Starting with a descriptive H1 title that includes the filename
2. Providing a brief overview of the file's purpose
3. Documenting any classes, functions, or key components with proper Markdown formatting
4. Highlighting important dependencies, design patterns, or architectural choices
5. Including links to related files with proper Obsidian internal link syntax: `[[filename]]`
6. Using proper Obsidian formatting, such as code blocks with appropriate language tags, YAML frontmatter with relevant tags, proper heading hierarchy, and callouts for important notes
7. Keeping the documentation detailed but concise

### Writing Documentation to Files
The script writes the generated documentation to a specific directory structure, with a README.md file providing an index of all the modules and individual files.

## Dependencies and Design Patterns

This script relies on the Anthropic API to generate the documentation, using the `Anthropic` module and the `claude-3-haiku-20240307` model. The script follows a modular design, with separate functions for processing files, generating documentation, and writing the output to files.

## Related Files

This script is part of the training scripts for the codebase, and it is likely related to other files in the same directory or module. Some potentially related files could be:

- [[root/other_training_script.py]]
- [[root/utils.py]]
- [[root/config.py]]
