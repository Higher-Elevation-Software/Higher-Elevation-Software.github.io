# claude_prompt.py Documentation

## Overview

This Python script is designed to analyze code files and generate comprehensive Obsidian-compatible documentation. It uses the Anthropic API to generate the documentation based on a predefined prompt.

The script processes all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories, excluding test files and certain directories. It then creates a hierarchical structure of Obsidian-formatted documentation, with a README.md file providing an index of all the modules and individual files.

## Key Components

1. **Configuration**: The script starts by configuring the Anthropic API client using an environment variable for the API key.
2. **File Selection**: The script determines the files to be processed, either based on command-line arguments or by searching for all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. **File Filtering**: The script filters out test files and certain directories to avoid processing unnecessary files.
4. **Documentation Generation**: For each file, the script creates a prompt for the Anthropic API, which includes the file content and a set of rules for the documentation format. The API response is then processed and stored in a dictionary, with the file path as the key.
5. **Output Generation**: The script writes the generated documentation to a specific directory structure, with a README.md file providing an index of all the modules and individual files.

## Dependencies and Design Patterns

The script uses the following dependencies:

- `os`: For file and directory operations
- `json`: For handling JSON data
- `glob`: For finding files in the file system
- `sys`: For accessing command-line arguments
- `anthropic`: For interacting with the Anthropic API

The script follows a modular design, with separate functions for file processing, documentation generation, and output writing. This allows for easier maintenance and potential future extensions.
